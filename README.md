# DarkEverywhere
DarkEverywhere is a CSS theme for [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) that provides dark mode for sites that don't natively support it.

## Why DarkEverywhere
DarkEverywhere isn't just a "one-stylesheet-fits-all" extension. While that approach does work, that doesn't work *well.* I've created individual themes for each support website to help preserve brand identity, use familiar color schemes, and make sure there aren't any glitches. That's why you can know for sure that DarkEverywhere works. On websites that do have a built-in dark theme, DarkEverywhere improves it - filling the gaps and creating a truly darkened experience.

## Supported Websites
